(Q: is the 'doc' folder going to be necessary??)
(A: I think probbaly yes; but it can be quite sparse, and consit of links to notebooks for a lot of stuff)



Plan for Examples Notebooks:


00 - Intro to ConWhAt

   - example with one atlas; talk about core methods , functions, etc.
     maybe lesion overlap analyses for some selected tracts or something; quick


01 - ConWhAt atlases

   - run through of all atlases available in conwhat
   -   (brief) descriptions of how they were made and where they came from
   - plots of networks + parcellations

02 - Lesion a network
   
   - use one or a few hand-drawn stroke type lesions
   - volumetric and streamlinetric
   - different modification functions (that could be another nb)


03 - Connectivity-based analysis of JHU atlas
   - use overlap to find connectome tracts etc
   - (this will be in the paper)


04 - Roll your own

     - discussion of the nipype pipeline(s) for building atlases



05 - Use with TVB


     - modify a connectome and show a difference in a quick tvb sim



Other stuff:


- registration, normalization, reslicing etc; going from a lesioned T1 image into the right space
- coordinate querying
- pure function usage; no classes
- don't get carried away!
